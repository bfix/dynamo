## Real-world models

### CHECO / Project CYBERSYN

[Project CYBERSYN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Cybersyn) (short for
CYBERnetic SYNergy) was the attempt of the British cybernetician
[Stafford Beer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stafford_Beer) to help manage
the Chilean economy (CHECO) with a single IBM mainframe and 99 telex machines
in 1972/73. The project was never finished; it ended with the coup d'etat
against the Allende presidency on Sepember 11<sup>th</sup>, 1973.

The CHECO simulator was written in DYNAMO; the very first version (1.0,
Sepember 10<sup>th</sup>, 1972) can be found in the `checo/` folder.
Never versions of the simulator are possibly lost; the first version was
recovered from documents found in the _Stafford Beer Collection_ at the
Liverpool John Moores University.

### World Dynamics

In his book _World Dynamics_ (published in 1971)
[J.W. Forrester][https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Wright_Forrester)
designed a model to simulate the system dynamics of the world's population,
food supply, natural resources, pollution and many other key features. This
model - called _WORLD2_ - was written in DYNAMO and published in the book
on pages 136-138.

A [newer DYNAMO model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World3) - called _WORLD3_ -
was used by Dennis Meadows et al. as a basis for the report "_The Limits to
Growth_".

Both models can be found in the folder `world/`.

**N.B.: The WORLD3 model is not available yet - hopefully coming soon!**

## Models from the book "Introduction to System Dynamics Modeling with DYNAMO"

The example models in the folder `book/` are taken from the book
**Introduction to System Dynamics Modeling with DYNAMO** by George P.
Richardson and Alexander L. Pugh III, The MIT Press, 1981 (ISBN
0-262-18102-9).

All models can be found below the `book/` folder.

## Miscellaneous models

A collection of DYNAMO models found in the wild is in the `rt/misc/` folder.

If you have old DYNAMO models and want to share them, please send them to me
with a description what they are about. Intersting models will be included in
this collection.
